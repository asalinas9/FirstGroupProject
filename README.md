# Comic Book Search App Group Project

In this project, we created a website app where you could search for your favority comic character. In this dynamic and responsive website, it allows the user to purchase their favorite comic book directly from eBay, which was used as part of the project with its API.

# The approach we took for bulding the website:
-capture user search input using a comics API (Comic Vine)
-Return Results from ComicVine API
-With EBAYs API, was used to return Links to each result, and allowing the user to purchase the comic book of choice.

# Issues 
The only issue we had with this project was due to the restrictions of the APIs used. Since both API had a limited amount per day to pull from, made it impossible to continue testing the app.

# Languages & Technologies used
HTML, Materialized CSS, APIs, Javascript, Jquery
